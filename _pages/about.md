Hi! I'm Yunus Talha Erzurumlu, a Ph.D. student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at The Ohio State University. My research revolves around computer vision, robotics, and deep learning, with a particular interest in multimodal perception, geo-localization, and 3D reconstruction.

I completed my B.S. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Middle East Technical University (METU/ODTÜ), where I developed a strong foundation in engineering and research. My time at METU shaped my academic journey and fueled my passion for robotics and AI-driven perception.

I’ve always been curious about how machines perceive and interact with the world, which led me to work in computer vision and robotics. Along the way, I’ve had the chance to work on some exciting projects in autonomous systems and deep learning.

Beyond research, I’m a big Fenerbahçe fan!

I’m always open to collaboration and discussion, so feel free to reach out!
